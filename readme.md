## Project Objective:
- Analyze US states labor force unemployment and participation trends over time.
- Understand the differences in participation rates between states.
- Use Time-Series data to identify long term trends and regional Differences.
- Clear and Comparative visualization assist in presenting Insights. 

## Problem Statement:
- Labor force Participation and unemployment trends differ significantly throughout the states across U.S states.
- Effective Analysis is necessary to interpret raw economic data that is complex to understand.
- Policymakers and Analysts require clear insights to understand workforce behaviour.
- This Project Turns Raw Data into insightful visuals.

## Project Workflow: 
- State Level Economic Data was acquired using official FRED API.
- Utilized Pandas to clean and process time-series data.
- Standardized Column Names and handled missing values.
- EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed to uncover hidden patterns.
- Matplotlib and Plotly were used to visualize state-wise comparison.

## Key Insights:
- During the 2008-09 Financial crisis, All the U.S states had their unemployment rate peak with some exceeding around 12-15%.
- California, Michigan and Nevada were the most affected by labor market stress.
- While Unemployment was high, labor force participation rates displayed a gradual upward or stabilizing trend.
- By 2010, a number of states began to show early signs of labor market recovery.

## Tools & Skills:
- Python
- Data Cleaning and Analysis: Numpy & Pandas
- Visualization: Matplotlib & Plotly
- Time-Series Analysis
- EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
