## Project Objective:
- Analyze US states labor force unemployment and participation trends over time.
- Understand the differences in participation rates between states.
- Use Time-Series data to identify long term trends and regional Differences.
- Clear and Comparative visualization assist in presenting Insights. 

## Problem Statement:
- Labor force Participation and unemployment trends differ significantly throughout the states across U.S states.
- Effective Analysis is necessary to interpret raw economic data that is complex to understand.
- Policymakers and Analysts require clear insights to understand workforce behaviour.
- This Project Turns Raw Data into insightful visuals.

# Project Workflow: 
- State Level Economic Data was acquired using official FRED API.
- Utilized Pandas to clean and process time-series data.
- Standardized Column Names and handled missing values.
- EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed to uncover hidden patterns.
- Matplotlib and Plotly were used to visualize state-wise comparison.
